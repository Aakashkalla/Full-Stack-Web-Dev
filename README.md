# 🚀 Full Stack Web Dev Journey – Day by Day

Welcome to my full stack web development learning repo!  
I'm tracking my daily progress by creating folders like `Day1`, `Day2`, and so on — each containing hands-on exercises, mini-projects, and cool bugs I’ll pretend were features.

## 🧠 What This Repo Is About

This isn't just a bunch of code – it's my developer diary.  
From basic HTML & CSS to JavaScript, backend, and full stack projects, everything I learn is getting documented right here.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- Day 1 – Basic HTML structure, CSS styling
- Day 2 – More CSS, maybe some box model wizardry
- Day N – Animations? JS DOM? Who knows, it's chaos
- ...and it keeps growing!

> Each folder = one day of learning, practicing, failing, and leveling up 💪

## 🛠️ Topics I'll Cover Along the Way

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, UI challenges
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (coming soon)
- Full Projects: Responsive layouts, mini clones, APIs, maybe even some React 👀

## 📌 Why This Repo Exists

- To learn by doing 🛠️  
- To stay consistent 📆  
- To look back and say: "Wow, I used to write that?!" 😂
